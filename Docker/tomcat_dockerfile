#now build docker file

This Dockerfile essentially customizes the default Tomcat setup by pre-populating 
the webapps directory with the default applications provided by Tomcat.

When building and running a container from this Dockerfile, you would get a 
Tomcat instance with the default web applications already deployed. 
Note that this approach can be useful when you want to customize Tomcat's behavior 
by modifying the default set of web applications.
